			<string>If you are using FMDB in your project, I'd love to hear about it.  Let Gus know
by sending an email to gus@flyingmeat.com.

And if you happen to come across either Gus Mueller or Rob Ryan in a bar, you
might consider purchasing a drink of their choosing if FMDB has been useful to
you.

Finally, and shortly, this is the MIT License.

生成GKit文件
$pod lib create GKit

修改GKit.podspec文件

将上传的代码放入class中执行
$cd /Users/gs/Documents/github/GKit/GKit/Example
$pod install

进入GKit首个目录
$cd /Users/gs/Documents/github/GKit/GKit
添加文件
$git add .
添加描述
$git commit -m 'firstCommit'
将本地仓库与远程仓库建立联系
$git remote add origin https://github.com/xiamoweinuan/GKit.git
//如果远程仓库上出现了你本地仓库不存在的提交分支，强行让本地分支覆盖远程分支git push origin master -f
$git push origin master
打tag
$git tag 0.0.5
上传tag
$git push --tags


****
问题1.github上生成仓库下方没有选，第一次提交是master，后来怎么变成main分支了，看对应两种上传方式
问题2.githubDesktop上不能直接提交，否则会出现验证的时候路径对不上，应该是和命令行上传的不一致
******

$cd /Users/gs/Documents/github/GKit/GKit
$git add .
$git commit -m "first commit"
$git branch -M main
$git remote add origin https://github.com/xiamoweinuan/GKit.git
$git push -u origin main
$git tag 0.0.5
$git push --tags

验证
$pod spec lint --verbose --allow-warnings --use-libraries
提交
$pod trunk push GKit.podspec --verbose --allow-warnings --use-libraries



//git push --tagspod spec lint --verbose --allow-warnings --use-libraries
//pod trunk push GKit.podspec --verbose --allow-warnings --use-libraries
//pod spec lint --use-libraries --allow-warnings  --skip-import-validation --skip-tests
//--skip-import-validation
